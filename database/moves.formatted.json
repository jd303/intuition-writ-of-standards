To Dodge, you must not be Encumbered or Rooted, and you must be aware of your attacker.  If you succeed, you reduce the incoming Verve Damage by 50% and you can move to an adjacent unoccupied square as a Free Action after all enemies have resolved their turns.  Additionally, on a Raw Roll of 20 you reduce the incoming Verve loss to 0.\n\nThe maximum number of points you can spend on Dodge each time you resolve it is equal to your Maximum Dodge value, which is a combination of your armour and bonuses from magic and Move Mods."

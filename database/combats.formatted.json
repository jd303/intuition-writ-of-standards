The drained can never see the true form, and become fascinated and overprotective of the Maladite, so much that they will protect it with their life.\n\nThe Maladite has extreme physical and magical resistance to those that cannot truly see it.  Magical divinations, detections and illusion dispels are twisted, such that the magic user knows that something is up, but cannot glean real information about it.\n\nThey say the Maladite\u2019s true form can be seen freely by one who truly wants for nothing.

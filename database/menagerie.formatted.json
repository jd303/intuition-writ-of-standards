Magical divinations, detections and illusion dispels are twisted, such that the magic user knows that something is up, but cannot glean real information about it.\n\nThey say the Maladiteâ€™s true form can be seen freely by one who truly wants for nothing.  And those who want more find themselves less able to see it."

While within its detecting range (variable due to the strength of the divination magics it has been provided), it will know where you are, and will expend its magics to power itself.  The magics can last months to years.  \n\nDue to the burning effect of the divination and elemental magics, people who attempt to stop or approach Alumentals experience vivid hallucinations of their past and future, wreathed in the elemental magic that was added.\n\nThe only way to truly destroy the Alumental is to find its Core Instructions in the deepest of its hearts, plunging your hand into the wet, oily, blood-like chambers of machinery and braving the very dangers that lie within.  Attempting to dismantle takes too long, it will reform with Self-Repair."

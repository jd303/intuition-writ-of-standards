While within its detecting range (variable due to the strength of the divination magics it has been provided), it will know where you are, and will expend its magics to power itself.  The magics can last months to years.  \n\nDue to the burning effect of the divination and elemental magics, people who attempt to stop or approach Alumentals experience vivid hallucinations of their past and future, wreathed in the elemental magic that was added.\n\nThe only way to truly destroy the Alumental is to find its Core Instructions in the deepest of its hearts, plunging your hand into the wet, oily, blood-like chambers of machinery and braving the very dangers that lie within.  Attempting to dismantle takes too long, it will reform with Self-Repair."

        "description": "A product of Ihn’egretcal Flow coalescing and festering, the Carrion Collector is an amalgamation of other bones of creatures forming into a tall, long-legged creature.  It lives in dark spaces, sometimes creating a burrow, and slowly feeds on the bones it has collected.  However when the bone hoard is used up, it needs to hunt.  This is usually as little as once every few years, but the event is horrific.  It clambers and climbs and hides where it can, striking at travellers and smaller villages, and harvests their bodies - alive or dead - storing them in its bone-cage body to take back to its nest."

The resultant creature is not truly deceased, not truly Undead, but a simalacrum of life with all the same properties.  They cannot remember who they are, and so take the form of someone they see at their death or near after, though there is something off about their look, and they imitate them poorly.\n\nThe Remembrance has a deep urge to remember, and so they use the remants of their psionic abilities to insert memories of their new forme into those around them, in the hopes of building a new existence.  Initially this is done by overlapping their ethereal form with another, and eventually they can do when near, and then afar.  Each time they do so successfully, they grow in power.\n\nParticularly powerful Remembrances - ones that have built themselves memories in the minds of others - have a chaotic, evil persona, and strive for larger and more wide-spread memories.\n\nThe ironic condition of the Remembrance is that the more it successfully uses Memory Overlay - it's preference when threatened into combat - the more it solidifies and becomes succeptible to physical attacks."
